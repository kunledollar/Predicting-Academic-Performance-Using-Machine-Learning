# Predicting-Academic-Performance-Using-Machine-Learning
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict student academic performance, specifically final year grades (G3), using a dataset from Portuguese secondary schools. The goal is to help educators identify students at risk of underperforming so that timely interventions and support can be provided.
